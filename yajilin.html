        <p>
          To set the colors of cells, right-click on a cell to turn dark,
          or middle-click to turn white.  Alternately, you can use the
          arrow keys to move around the board, and press the space bar
          to toggle between the states, the '1' key to turn black,
          or the '0' key to turn white.  You can not alter the state
          of a square with a number and arrow value.
        </p>
        <p>
          To draw a path, left click on the center of a white cell to
          begin. From there, drag the mouse in the direction to create
          the path. The path will draw as the dragging continues. Alternately,
          once on the board, you can press the shift key and hold while
          moving around the board with the arrow keys. In addition, you
          can enter a key to indicate the type of path desired for that
          cell (and into its neighbors). These keys are as follows, and
          will extend the line into the center of the adjoining cells:
          <ul>
            <li>'-' key to draw a full horizontal line through the cell</li>
            <li>'|' or 'I' key to draw a full vertical line through the cell</li>
            <li>'L','J','7', or 'F' key to draw a correspondingly shaped turn in the cell</li>
          </ul>
          Once created, a path can be removed by pressing the backspace
          key within a white cell. This deletes it just for this cell,
          but deletes the "arms" into the adjoining cells. You can also
          attempt to redraw with the left-click dragging method.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can press the '.' key to temporarily insert a dot in a
          cell to indicate that it will eventually need a path. A
          backspace clears the dot.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Assist Mode (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or incomplete numbers is indicated.  In Assist Mode (1), the
          number of errors and incomplete numbers is indicated, see game rules.
          In Assist Mode (2), errors and completed rules are highlighted
          with digit colors.  In some cases the solve difficulty will
          greatly decrease in Assist Mode (2), so select depending upon
          the level of challenge desired. The game border will turn
          green if the grid is completed without error.  You can click
          the "undo" button on the bottom of the page to undo previous moves.

          Below, enter puzzle code (0-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>)
          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). Puzzle 0 shows an example of a completed
          puzzle. The following puzzle codes have demos, which will walk
          you through a solve to help you on the path to mastery:

        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/yajilin" target="_blank">Yajilin</a>
        (&#x30E4;&#x30B8;&#x30EA;&#x30F3; or roughly "Arrow Link"),
        is a classic Japanese logic puzzle published by 
        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>.
        In Yajilin, the board begins with a collection of numbers and
        arrows within gray squares. These numbers and arrows indicate
        the number of black squares to be placed in the direction given.
        All numbers must be satisfied in order to complete the puzzle.
        In addition, a single continuous path must pass through all
        white squares.  The rules below relate to those numbers and
        how to complete the puzzle.
        <ol>
          <li>
            A digit with an arrow indicates the number of black cells on
            the board to the direction of the arrow. I.e. a '3&uarr;'
            cell means there must be three black cells above the 3 digit
            before the edge of the board.
          </li>
          <li>
            Digit cells are gray, and indicate that they do not need
            to be crossed with the path.
          </li>
          <li>
            Black squares may not touch horizontally or vertically, but
            may touch diagonally. It is OK for a black cell to touch
            a gray digit cell.
          </li>
          <li>
            A single continuous path must be drawn that goes through
            all white squares. The path must connect back with itself
            but can't cross itself or enter the same square twice.
          </li>
          <li>
            There will be some cells that are not under the rules of
            given directional digits. Those cells may end up black or
            white but must not violate the above rules.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div id="tab3" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        <p>
          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          Puzzle 0 shows a completed correct puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH:&lt;digit-arrow-descriptor&gt;", where W is a
          number indicating the width of the grid, and H the height.
          The digit descriptor is a list of the pre-defined
          digit contents plus an arrow direction, from left to right,
          then top to bottom. The arrow directions are indicated with
          ^ for up, v for down, &lt; for left, or &gt; for right.
          Blank cells are represented with a '-' character. To assist
          in the definition of a sparse board, a combination of <i>b</i>
          consecutive blanks can be represented with a lowercase letter
          from 'a' to 'z', corresponding to 1 to 26 consecutive blanks.
          Digit values greater than '9' should be represented with
          capital letters 'A' to 'Z' representing 10 to 35.  A dot '.'
          can be used as a visual separator, for example between rows.
          An example descriptor is as follows for entry 1:
          '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Yajilin there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
