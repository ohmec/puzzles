          To draw a path, left click on the center of a cell to
          begin. From there, drag the mouse in the direction to create
          the path. The path will draw as the dragging continues. Alternately,
          once on the board, you can press the shift key and hold while
          moving around the board with the arrow keys. In addition, you
          can enter a key to indicate the type of path desired for that
          cell (and into its neighbors). These keys are as follows, and
          will extend the line into the center of the adjoining cells:
          <ul>
            <li>'-' key to draw a full horizontal line through the cell</li>
            <li>'|' or 'I' key to draw a full vertical line through the cell</li>
            <li>'L','J','7', or 'F' key to draw a correspondingly shaped turn in the cell</li>
          </ul>
          Once created, a path can be removed by pressing the backspace
          key within a white cell. This deletes it just for this cell,
          but deletes the "arms" into the adjoining cells. You can also
          attempt to redraw with the left-click dragging method.
        </p>

          In Assist Mode (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or incomplete numbers is indicated.  In Assist Mode (1), the
          number of errors and incomplete numbers is indicated, see game rules.
          In Assist Mode (2), errors and completed rules are highlighted
          with digit colors.  In some cases the solve difficulty will
          greatly decrease in Assist Mode (2), so select depending upon
          the level of challenge desired. The game border will turn
          green if the grid is completed without error.  You can click
          the "undo" button on the bottom of the page to undo previous moves.

          Below, enter puzzle code (0-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>)
          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). Puzzle 0 shows an example of a completed
          puzzle. The following puzzle codes have demos, which will walk
          you through a solve to help you on the path to mastery:

        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/mid_loop" target="_blank">Mid-loop</a>
        (&#x30DF;&#x30C3;&#x30C9;&#x30EB;&#x30FC;&#x30D7;), is a less known
        Japanese logic puzzle published by
        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>,
        similar to its more complex sister <a href="./masyu.html">Masyu</a>.
        In Mid-loop, the board begins with a collection of black circles,
        either in the center of white squares, or in the border between
        two squares. These circles have rules about a path that must be drawn
        through them. The final path drawn must go through all circles,
        and must form a continuous loop.  The rules below relate to those 
        circles and how to complete the puzzle.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lines must be drawn through all circles to make a continuous
            loop.
          </li>
          <li>
            The loop may go through the circles horizontally or
            vertically. The loop may not cross itself, branch off,
            or go through the same cell twice.
          </li>
          <li>
            All circles must be completed with the path, with the
            black circle as the midpoint of a straight line segment
            passing through the circle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not all squares without circles require the path to go
            through them.
          </li>
        </ol>

          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          Puzzle 0 shows a completed correct puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH:&lt;circle-descriptor&gt;", where W is a
          number indicating the width of the grid, and H the height.
          The circle descriptor is a list of the pre-defined circle
          contents plus the spaces in between them, from left to right,
          then top to bottom.  For the circles, the character * is used
          to indicate a black circle in the center of a cell, or a
          directional character "^", "V", "&lt;", or "&gt;" indicating
          a black circle in the wall to the north, south, west or east
          of the cell, respectively. Blank cells are represented with
          a '-' character. To assist in the definition of a sparse board,
          a combination of <i>b</i> consecutive blanks can be represented
          with a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', corresponding to
          1 to 26 consecutive blanks.  A dot '.' can be used as a
          visual separator, for example between rows.  An example
          descriptor is as follows for entry 1:
          '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Mid-loop there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
