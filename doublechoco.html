          To play, left-click on a border between cells to create a wall
          between cells, or right-click to remove a wall. You can drag
          around to continue to draw the wall, or erase the wall. Alternately,
          once on a boundary, you can shift-move to add more borders in the
          direction of arrow keys. Additionally, if the cursor is on a wall,
          you can press the space bar to toggle the wall state, or press
          '1' to set, or '0' or backspace to clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Assist Mode (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or incomplete numbers is indicated.  In Assist Mode (1), the
          number of errors and incomplete numbers is indicated, see game rules.
          In Assist Mode (1) or higher, each numbered square is given a different
          color to visually guide the solver in searching for room
          completions.  In Assist Mode (2) errors are highlighted with cell
          colors, and correct completed rooms are indicated as well. Note 
          this does not ensure that they are correct in the final solution,
          just that they are correct with respect to the rules. In some cases
          the solve difficulty will greatly decrease in Assist Mode (1) or
          higher, so select depending upon the level of challenge desired.
          The game border will turn green if the grid is completed without
          error.  You can click the "undo" button on the bottom of the page
          to undo previous moves.

          Below, enter puzzle code (0-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>)
          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). Puzzle code 0 shows an example completed
          puzzle that can be helpful. The following puzzle codes have demos,
          which will walk you through a solve to help you on the path to
          mastery: <span id='demolist1'>[]</span>).

        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/double_choco" target="_blank">Double Choco</a>
        (<span id="jpfont">&#x30C0;&#x30D6;&#x30EB;&#x30C1;&#x30E7;&#x30B3;</span>)
        is a newer Japanese logic puzzle published by 
        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>.
        In Double Choco, the board begins with half of the cells grayed out, and
        half white. Some cells have numbers. The contents of the cells can not
        be modified. Instead, the user must draw borders between cells in order
        to satisfy the set of rules below.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Draw borders around collections of cells containing an equal number
            of white cells and gray cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cells with numbers in them indicate the number of white cells <b>and</b>
            gray cells that must be in the room that contains them. For instance,
            a cell with a '5' digit within it must eventually be in a room with
            10 total cells: 5 white and 5 black.
          </li>
          <li>
            A room can have more than one of the same number within, or no numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within a completed room, the two halves (white and gray) must be
            of the same shape; rotations and mirror images are OK. For instance,
            a '4' room could have one white 'L' shape "on its back" (&#x23D7;)
            and a gray one flipped and reversed (&#x393;). They must be touching
            horizontally or vertically.
          </li>
      </div>
      <div id="tab3" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        <p>
          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          Puzzle 0 shows a completed correct puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH:&lt;digit-descriptor&gt;", where W is a number
          indicating the width of the grid, and H the height.
          The digit descriptor is a list of the pre-defined
          digit contents, from left to right, then top to bottom.
          Blank cells are represented with a '-' character. To assist
          in the definition of a sparse board, a combination of <i>b</i>
          consecutive blanks can be represented with a lowercase letter
          from 'a' to 'z', corresponding to 1 to 26 consecutive blanks.
          Digit values greater than '9' should be represented with
          capital letters 'A' to 'Z' representing 10 to 35.  A dot '.'
          can be used as a visual separator, for example between rows.
          An example descriptor is as follows for entry 1:
          '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Double Choco there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
