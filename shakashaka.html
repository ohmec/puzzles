          A left-click on a while cell toggles through all potential
          settings for the cell, starting with a black triangle in
          the NE corner, then rotating SE, SW, NW, then back to white.
          That is &#x25e5; &rarr; &#x25e2; &rarr; &#x25e3; &rarr; &#x25e4;
          &rarr; white.  Alternately you can use arrow keys to move around
          the board, and press the space bar to toggle through the options,
          or press '1' - '4' to set a triangle in the corresponding corner
          (starting with '1' for NE &#x25e5; and moving clockwise to '4'
          for &#x25e4;), or '0' or the backspace key to return to white.
          You can right-click or press the '.' button to put a dot
          place-holder for a cell that, by your determination, must stay
          white.

          In Assist Mode (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or incomplete numbered cells is indicated.  In Assist Mode
          (1), the number of errors and incomplete cells is indicated,
          see game rules.  In Assist Mode (2), errors and completed
          number are highlighted with colors.  In some cases the solve
          difficulty will greatly decrease in Assist Mode (2), so select
          depending upon the level of challenge desired. The game border
          will turn green if the grid is completed without error.  You
          can click the "undo" button on the bottom of the page to undo
          previous moves.

          Below, enter puzzle code (0-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>)
          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). The following puzzle codes have demos,
          which will walk you through a solve to help you on the path to
          mastery: <span id='demolist1'>[]</span>).

        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/shakashaka/" target="_blank">Shakashaka</a>
        (&#x30B7;&#x30E3;&#x30AB;&#x30B7;&#x30E3;&#x30AB;)
        is a unique Japanese logic puzzle published by 
        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>.
        In Shakashaka, the board begins with a number of black squares, some
        with numbers, and some without.  The goal is to paint some of the
        white cells with triangles in one of the four corners of the
        cell, that is &#x25e5; &#x25e2; &#x25e3; or &#x25e4;. A cell
        can't be set to be completely black, but can be left white.
        The rules below apply to these numbered cells and the triangular
        cells.
        <ol>
          <li>
            A black square with a number indicates how many triangles
            must be horizontally or vertically adjacent to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            A black square with no number has an unconstrained number
            of triangles adjacent to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            To complete the board, all white spaces must be creating
            a rectangular shape. That is, a rectangular combination
            of white squares, or a combination of white squares and
            white portions of triangular cells that forms a rectangle
            of any size.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Enter puzzle #0 in the tab below to see a completed puzzle.
      </div>
      <div id="tab3" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        <p>
          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          Puzzle 0 shows a completed correct puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH:&lt;descriptor&gt;", where W is a number indicating
          the width of the grid, and H the height.  The descriptor is
          a list of the black squares with numbers 0-4, or a '*' for
          a black square without a digit, from left to right, then
          top to bottom.  To assist in the definition of a sparse board,
          a combination of <i>b</i> consecutive white squares can be
          represented with a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z',
          corresponding to 1 to 26 consecutive squares.  A dot '.'
          can be used as a visual separator, for example between rows.
          An example descriptor is as follows for entry 1:
          '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Shakashaka there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
