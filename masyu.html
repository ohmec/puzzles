        <p>
          In the game Masyu, the goal is to draw a single path through
          all circles that follow the rules of the game (see Rules tab).
          To draw a path, you can use the mouse or button keys:
          <ul>
            <li>
              With the mouse you can <b>left click</b> on the center of
              a cell to begin a path. From there, <b>drag</b> the mouse
              in the direction to create the path.  The path will draw
              as the dragging continues.
            </li>
            <li>
              Alternately, once on the board, you can press the
              <b>shift key</b> and hold while moving around the board
              with the <b>arrow keys</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition, you can enter a key to indicate the type
              of path desired for that cell (and into its neighbors).
              These keys are as follows, and will extend the line
              into the center of the adjoining cells:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>'-' key</b> to draw a full horizontal line
                  through the cell
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>'|'</b> or <b>'I'</b> key to draw a full
                  vertical line through the cell
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>'L','F','7'</b>, or <b>'7'</b> key to draw a
                  correspondingly shaped turn in the cell (i.e.
                  a left turn starting from the N, E, S, or
                  W direction).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Once created, a path can be removed by pressing
              the <b>backspace key</b> within a white cell. This
              deletes it just for this cell, but deletes the
              "arms" into the adjoining cells.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can also attempt to redraw with the <b>left-click</b>
              dragging method.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In <b>Assist Mode</b> (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or incomplete numbers is indicated.  In Assist Mode (1), the
          number of errors and incomplete numbers is indicated, see game rules.
          In Assist Mode (2), errors and completed rules are highlighted
          with digit colors.  In some cases the solve difficulty will
          greatly decrease in Assist Mode (2), so select depending upon
          the level of challenge desired. The game border will turn
          green if the grid is completed without error.  You can click
          the "undo" button on the bottom of the page to undo previous moves.

          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). <b>Puzzle code 0</b> shows an example completed

        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/masyu" target="_blank">Masyu</a>
        (<span id="jpfont">&#x307E;&#x3057;&#x3085;</span>), is a classic Japanese
        logic puzzle published by <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>.
        In Masyu, the board begins with a collection of white and black
        circles. These circles have rules about a path that must be drawn
        through them. The final path drawn must go through all circles,
        and must form a continuous loop.  The rules below relate to those 
        circles and how to complete the puzzle.
        <ol>
          <li>
            A white circle must be traveled straight through by the
            path, with no change of direction. In addition, the path
            must turn in either of the squares before or after the
            circle in the direction of the path.
          </li>
          <li>
            The path going through a black circles must turn in that
            square, and must continue at least one more square in
            both directions.
          </li>
          <li>
            All circles must be completed with the path.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not all squares without circles require the path to go
            through them.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div id="tab3" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        <p>
          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          <b>0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span></b>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          <b>Puzzle 0</b> shows a completed correct puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH:&lt;circle-descriptor&gt;", where W is a
          number indicating the width of the grid, and H the height.
          The circle descriptor is a list of the pre-defined circle
          contents plus the spaces in between them, from left to right,
          then top to bottom.  For the circles, the number 1 is used
          to indicate a white circle; 2 for a black circle. Blank
          cells are represented with a '-' character. To assist in
          the definition of a sparse board, a combination of
          <i>b</i> consecutive blanks can be represented
          with a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', corresponding to
          1 to 26 consecutive blanks. A dot '.' can be used as a
          visual separator, for example between rows.  An example
          descriptor is as follows for entry 1:
          '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Masyu there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
