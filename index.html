        is nominally about historical maps (Open Historical Map
        Exploration, roughly).  But we love some puzzles. This area
        contains several playgrounds for (predominantly) Japanese
        logic puzzles that we have fallen in love with. The available
        ones are listed below. Each playground environment allows the
        user to select one of several pre-canned puzzles curated from
        a list of well crafted specimens. Users can also enter their
        own from other sources, with instructions on how to translate
        a puzzle into a descriptor. Each environment has a range
        of playability modes, from largely non-helpful to graphically
        assisting the completion, e.g. indicating errors as they are
        made and highlighting to-be-solved areas. No "solve" buttons
        are provided, it is not intended to be a "cheat", simply a
        playground. The playground will indicate when a puzzle is
        completed by changing the board's border to green.

        The list of currently available playgrounds is given here.

        been updated to the new rendering system yet.  Please enjoy.
