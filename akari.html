          A left-click on the board adds a light bulb to a white
          square, or removes one that is already there. Alternately
          you can use arrow keys to move around the board, and press
          the space bar to toggle light bulbs, or the '1' key to add
          a bulb, or '0' key or backspace to remove. You can right-click
          or press the '.' button to put a dot place-holder for a cell
          that, by your determination, can not contain a light bulb
          (for instance next to a '0' black cell).
        </p>
        <p>
          In Assist Mode (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or un-illuminated white cells  is indicated.  In Assist Mode
          (1), the number of errors and incomplete cells is indicated,
          see game rules.  In Assist Mode (2), errors and illuminated rooms
          are highlighted with colors.  In some cases the solve difficulty will
          greatly decrease in Assist Mode (2), so select depending upon
          the level of challenge desired. The game border will turn
          green if the grid is completed without error.  You can click
          the "undo" button on the bottom of the page to undo previous moves.

          Below, enter puzzle code (0-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>)
          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). The following puzzle codes have demos,
          which will walk you through a solve to help you on the path to
          mastery: <span id='demolist1'>[]</span>).

        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/akari" target="_blank">Akari</a>
        (&#x660E;&#x304B;&#x308A; or "Light"),
        is a Japanese logic puzzle published by 
        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>.
        In Akari, the board begins with a collection of black squares,
        some with numbers, and some without, and white "hallways".
        The goal is to make sure there is a source of "light" for every
        hallway, created by the placing of light bulbs. The rules
        below relate to the numbers, the light bulbs, and how to
        complete the puzzle.
        <ol>
          <li>
            A black square with a number indicates how many light bulbs
            are adjacent to it, from zero to four.
          </li>
          <li>
            Light bulbs in white squares illuminate all other white
            squares horizontally and vertically in all directions
            until the light is blocked by a black square or the edge
            of the board.
          </li>
          <li>
            To complete the puzzle, all white squares must be illuminated.
          </li>
          <li>
            No light bulb can be illuminated by another light bulb.
          </li>
          <li>
            Light bulbs do not need to be next to a numbered square.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div id="tab3" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        <p>
          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          Puzzle 0 shows a completed correct puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH:&lt;descriptor&gt;", where W is a number indicating
          the width of the grid, and H the height.  The descriptor is
          a list of the black squares with numbers 0-4, or a '*' for
          a black square without a digit, from left to right, then
          top to bottom.  To assist in the definition of a sparse board,
          a combination of <i>b</i> consecutive white squares can be
          represented with a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z',
          corresponding to 1 to 26 consecutive squares.  A dot '.'
          can be used as a visual separator, for example between rows.
          An example descriptor is as follows for entry 1:
          '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Akari there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
