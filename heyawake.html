          To play, click on a cell to switch from indeterminant (gray,
          the default state) to dark or to light. Alternately,
          you can use the arrow keys to move around the board, and press
          back space to return to indeterminant, or the '1' key to
          turn black, the '0' key to turn white, or the space bar to toggle
          through the states.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Assist Mode (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or incomplete rooms is indicated.  In Assist Mode (1), the
          number of errors and incomplete rooms is indicated, see game rules.
          In Assist Mode (2), errors are highlighted with digit colors, and
          completed rules are highlighted with tile colors. In some cases
          the solve difficulty will greatly decrease in Assist Mode (2),
          so select depending upon the level of challenge desired. The
          canvas border will turn green if the grid is completed without
          error.  You can click the "undo" button on the bottom of the
          page to undo previous moves.

          Below, enter puzzle code (0-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>)
          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). The following puzzle codes have demos,
          which will walk you through a solve to help you on the path to
          mastery: <span id='demolist1'>[]</span>).

        (&#x3078;&#x3084;&#x308f;&#x3051;, or "divided rooms")
        is a classic Japanese logic puzzle published by
        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>.
        In Heyawake, the puzzle board is divided into rectangular rooms,
        some with digits within them, and some without.  The rules relate
        to these digits and the size and shape of the rooms with respect
        to their neighbors.
        <ol>
          <li>
            A room with a number within its borders indicates how many
            black cells must be within the room. Rooms without borders
            can have any otherwise legal number of black cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two black squares can not touch adjacently, diagonally is ok.
          </li>
          <li>
            The enabled (white) cells must all form one contiguous "river"
            of cells, connected to each other in the vertical or horizontal
            direction. A river is not considered connected if it only flows
            through diagonally adjacent white cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            A contiguous sequence of white cells can not extend into
            three consecutive rooms, either horizontally or vertically.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Below select puzzle 0 to see a completed sample grid.
        See the Game Play or Puzzles tab for how to invoke a demo.
      </div>
      <div id="tab3" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        <p>
          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          Puzzle 0 shows a completed correct puzzle.
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH:&lt;digit-descriptor&gt;:&lt;room-descriptors&gt;",
          where W is a number indicating the width of the grid, and H
          the height.  The digit descriptor is a list of the pre-defined
          digit contents, from left to right, then top to bottom.
          Blank cells are represented with a '-' character. To assist
          in the definition of sparse digits, a combination of <i>b</i>
          consecutive blanks can be represented with a lowercase letter
          from 'a' to 'z', corresponding to 1 to 26 consecutive blanks.
          A dot '.' can be used as a visual separator, for example between
          rows.  The room descriptors are a description of the individual
          rooms with a 4-character code for each room including, in order,
          <i>xywh</i> where <i>x,y</i> describes the starting location
          and <i>w,h</i> describes the room's width and height. Values
          greater than 9 should use a-z to represent 10-35. For instance
          a 3-wide 2-high room at coordinate location 12,3 should be
          designated as 'c332'. An example descriptor is as follows for entry 1:
          '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Heyawake there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
