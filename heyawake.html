          To play, click on a cell to switch between light, dark, and the
          default indeterminate state.  A left-click turns it black, a
          right-click turns to white, and a middle-click returns to
          indeterminate. Once the mouse is pressed down, you can drag
          the mouse to set multiple squares in one sequence.
          Alternately, you can use the arrow keys to move
          around the board, and press the space bar to toggle between
          the states, or the '1' key to turn black, the '0' key to turn
          white, or the backspace key to set back to indeterminate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Assist Mode (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or incomplete rooms is indicated.  In Assist Mode (1), the
          number of errors and incomplete rooms is indicated, see game rules.
          In Assist Mode (2), errors are highlighted with digit colors, and
          completed rules are highlighted with tile colors. In some cases
          the solve difficulty will greatly decrease in Assist Mode (2),
          so select depending upon the level of challenge desired. The
          canvas border will turn green if the grid is completed without
          error.  You can press the "undo" button on the bottom of the
          page to undo previous moves.

          Below, enter puzzle code (0-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>)
          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). The following puzzle codes have demos,
          which will walk you through a solve to help you on the path to
          mastery: <span id='demolist1'>[]</span>).

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyawake" target="_blank">Heyawake</a>
        (&#x3078;&#x3084;&#x308f;&#x3051;, or "divided rooms")
        is a classic Japanese logic puzzle published by
        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>.
        In Heyawake, the puzzle board is divided into rectangular rooms,
        some with digits within them, and some without.  The rules relate
        to these digits and the size and shape of the rooms with respect
        to their neighbors.
        <ol>
          <li>
            A room with a number within its borders indicates how many
            black cells must be within the room. Rooms without borders
            can have any otherwise legal number of black cells.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two black squares can not touch adjacently, diagonally is ok.
          </li>
          <li>
            A contiguous sequence of white cells can not extend into
            three consecutive rooms, either horizontally or vertically.
          </li>
          <li>
            The enabled (white) cells must all form one contiguous "river"
            of cells, connected to each other in the vertical or horizontal
            direction. A river is not considered connected if it only flows
            through diagonally adjacent white cells.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Below select puzzle 0 to see a completed sample grid.
        See the Game Play or Puzzles tab for how to invoke a demo.
      </div>
      <div id="tab3" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        <p>
          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          Puzzle 0 shows a completed correct puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH:&lt;room-descriptors&gt;", where W is a number
          indicating the width of the grid, and H the height.  The
          room descriptors are a description of the individual
          rooms with a 5-character code for each room including,
          in order, <i>yxhwd</i> where <i>y,x</i> describes the
          starting location and <i>h,w</i> describes the room's width
          and height. The puzzle matrix should be thought of as starting
          at 0,0 in the top left corner, with <i>y</i> increasing down,
          and <i>x</i> increasing across. The value <i>d</i> is the count
          of black cells expected for the room. If there is no value,
          then the character '-' should be used instead. Values greater
          than 9 should use a-z to represent 10-35. For instance a 2-digit
          2-high 3-wide room at y,x coordinate location 12,3 should be
          designated as 'c3232'. An example descriptor is as follows for
          entry 1: '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'. If the board is
          blank, there are likely descriptor errors that can be debugged
          by pressing F12 to see the javascript error output.

          For Heyawake there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
