          In Fillomino, the goal is to place a number in every cell in
          order to complete the puzzle according to the rules (see
          Rules tab). To play, you can click on a cell or move around
          with the arrow keys, then enter a digit.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use the mouse <b>left-click</b> to move the cursor to
              a desired cell.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once selected, <b>arrow keys</b> can be used to move
              around the canvas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use digit keys <b>1-9</b> to enter a single-digit value
            </li>
            <li>
              Use letter keys <b>A-Z</b> for double digit values 10-35,
              respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bold digits are the initial puzzle values, and can not
              be overwritten.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can also <b>left-click</b> on an existing number 
              and "drag" it to other cells to overwrite their value
              with its value.
            </li>
            <li>
              Similarly you can press and hold the <b>shift key</b>,
              then use the <b>arrow keys</b> to move around the board
              to propagate the current number to other cells.
            </li>
            <li>
              To remove an entered number, you can <b>right-click</b>
              the cell, or press the <b>back space</b> to clear.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can also drag a cleared cell with the mouse
              <b>left-click</b> or <b>shift- and arrow keys</b>
              to clear out new cells.
            </li>
            <li>
              For visualization of numerical boundaries, you can
              <b>left-click</b> on a cell border between cells to make
              a note of expected numeric separations, though no error
              checking is made.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can <b>right-click</b> to remove drawn borders, but
              not calculated ones.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once on a boundary, you can <b>shift- arrow move</b> to add
              more borders. You can also <b>drag left-click</b> to
              draw borders, or <b>drag right-click</b> to clear borders.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
          In <b>Assist Mode</b> (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or incomplete numbers is indicated.  In Assist Mode (1), the
          number of errors and incomplete numbers is indicated, see game rules.
          In Assist Mode (1) or higher, each numbered square is given a different
          color to visually guide the solver in searching for room
          completions.  In Assist Mode (2) errors are highlighted with red
          digit colors.  Additionally, borders are drawn between different digit
          cells and around rooms as they are completed.  In some cases the solve
          difficulty will greatly decrease in Assist Mode (1) or higher, so
          select depending upon the level of challenge desired. The game border
          will turn green if the grid is completed without error.  You can click
          the "undo" button on the bottom of the page to undo previous moves.

          Below, enter <b>puzzle code (0-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>)</b>
          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). <b>Puzzle code 0</b> shows an example completed
          puzzle that can be helpful. The following puzzle codes have
          <b>demos</b>, which will walk you through a solve to help you
          on the path to mastery: <span id='demolist1'>[]</span>).

        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/fillomino" target="_blank">Fillomino</a>
        (<span id="jpfont">&#x30D5;&#x30A3;&#x30EB;&#x30AA;&#x30DF;&#x30CE;</span>)
        is a classic Japanese logic puzzle published by 
        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>.
        In Fillomino, the board begins with some pre-set cells with numbers in them.
        These numbers can not be modified, but indicate the size of a "room" or
        polyomino (collection of squares) containing only those numbers. For
        instance, a cell with '9' on it must be combined with eight other squares
        of any shape - connected horizontally or vertically - all containing the
        number 9. The full set of rules below relate to those numbers and how to
        complete the puzzle.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pre-set number cells can not be modified, and must be part of a
            room with that number of squares joined horizontally or vertically.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collections of like-numbered digits cannot border other collections of
            the same digit. For instance, a legal collection of '4' cells cannot
            border another collection of '4' cells. Put another way, a collection
            of 5 or more adjacent '4' digits is illegal. If in assist mode 2,
            the canvas will indicate this with red-colored digits once the
            collection is in error.  Similarly a collection that has no chance
            of growing as large as needed to make it of legal size turns digits red.
            It is legal to connect two rooms with the same number at a diagonal
            point, i.e. not connected horizontally or vertically.
          </li>
          <li>
            All squares must have a number before the puzzle can be solved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not all eventual rooms will have pre-set number cells within them.
            The solver must often infer what value the cells must have in 
            order to complete the puzzle without error.
          </li>
      </div>
      <div id="tab3" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        <p>
          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          <b>0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span></b>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          <b>Puzzle 0</b> shows a completed correct puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH:&lt;digit-descriptor&gt;", where W is a number
          indicating the width of the grid, and H the height.
          The digit descriptor is a list of the pre-defined
          digit contents, from left to right, then top to bottom.
          Blank cells are represented with a '-' character. To assist
          in the definition of a sparse board, a combination of <i>b</i>
          consecutive blanks can be represented with a lowercase letter
          from 'a' to 'z', corresponding to 1 to 26 consecutive blanks.
          Digit values greater than '9' should be represented with
          capital letters 'A' to 'Z' representing 10 to 35.  A dot '.'
          can be used as a visual separator, for example between rows.
          An example descriptor is as follows for entry 1:
          '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Fillomino there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
