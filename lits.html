          To play, click on a cell to switch between light, dark, and the
          default indeterminate state.  A left-click turns it dark, a
          right-click turns to white, and a middle-click returns to
          indeterminate. Once the mouse is pressed down, you can drag
          the mouse to set multiple squares in one sequence.
          Alternately, you can use the arrow keys to move
          around the board, and press the space bar to toggle between
          the states, or the '1' key to turn black, the '0' key to turn
          white, or the backspace key to set back to indeterminate.
          Once on a cell, you can drag its color by holding the shift
          key and moving the arrow keys up down left or right.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Assist Mode (0), the default, only the existance of errors
          or incomplete rooms is indicated.  In Assist Mode (1), the
          number of errors and incomplete rooms is indicated, see game rules.
          In Assist Mode (2), errors are highlighted with different colors
          (red for violating the 2x2 rule (see Rules Tab), yellow for
          an incorrect shape), and completed LITS shapes are highlighted
          with green colors. In some cases the solve difficulty will
          greatly decrease in Assist Mode (2), so select depending upon
          the level of challenge desired. The canvas border will turn
          green if the grid is completed without error.  You can press
          the "undo" button on the bottom of the page to undo previous moves.

          Below, enter puzzle code (0-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>)
          for one of a list of pre-defined puzzles, or a puzzle descriptor
          (see "Puzzles" tab). The following puzzle codes have demos,
          which will walk you through a solve to help you on the path to
          mastery: <span id='demolist1'>[]</span>).

        <a href="https://nicoli.co.jp/en/lits" target="_blank">LITS</a>
        is a Japanese logic puzzle published by
        <a href="https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en" target="_blank">Nikoli</a>.
        In LITS, the puzzle board begins with a collection of "polyominos",
        or collections of blank cells forming a room of various sizes and
        shapes.  The player must set some of the cells dark, and the rest
        white, forming only the four-cell shapes 'L', 'I', 'T', or 'S', in any
        orientation. The rules relate these shapes and their arrangement
        on the solution board.
        <ol>
          <li>
            A room can only have four cells within it turned dark,
            and the remainder must be white.
          </li>
          <li>
            The arrangement of the dark squares must resemble the letters
            'L', 'I', 'T' or 'S'. See the completed solution using puzzle
            entry number 0 for an example.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identical shapes (two 'L' shapes, for instance) can not touch
            vertically or horizontally, no matter their orientation.
            Diagonally touching is acceptable.
          </li>
          <li>
            No 2x2 square of cells can be entirely shaded dark.
          </li>
          <li>
            The dark cells must all form one contiguous "river"
            of cells, connected to each other in the vertical or
            horizontal direction. A river is not considered connected
            if it only flows through diagonally adjacent dark cells.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Below select puzzle 0 to see a completed sample grid.
        See the Game Play or Puzzles tab for how to invoke a demo.

        <p>
          Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
          0-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span>, or through a character
          description of the puzzle itself, entered into the Display
          form on the 'Game Play' tab. The numbered puzzles are
          hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
          Puzzle 0 shows a completed correct puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
          form: "WxH::&lt;wall-descriptor-rows:&lt;wall-descriptor-columns&gt;",
          where W is a number indicating the width of the grid, and H
          the height.  The wall descriptors are a description of the
          true/false nature of the walls for each row, and then each
          column. These are denoted in hexadecimal value, which is
          a value from 0 to 15 denoted as 0-9,a-f for each collection
          of 4 walls, ignoring the sides. As an example, if a grid is
          8 columns wide, then 7 wall values are needed to define the
          walls between column 0 and 1, then 1 and 2, etc. These 7
          values are described in two-character hex values from 00 to
          fe. Extra unused bits for the end of a row or column are
          ignored, and each new row or column begins with a new hex
          pair or triplet. So if the top row has a wall between columns
          0 and 1, and between columns 5 and 6, that would be binary
          value of 1000010, which is represented as the hex pair of
          84.  An example descriptor is as follows for entry 1:
          '<span id="descr1">descr</span>'.

          For LITS there are <span id='democount'>1</span> demo
          puzzles that can be helpful to walk through solving methods.
          They are puzzle codes <span id='demolist2'>[]</span>.
          Enter them in the Game Play tab with the code number and there
          will be added a demo panel to help with the solve.
