        <p>To play, click on the line between vertices to toggle between on and off.
        The lines must be connected together into one loop as per the rules
        explained on the Rules tab. A second click can mark a line as "disabled".
        You can also click on the tile space and then hit the spacebar to toggle
        between white and gray. This has no influence on the solving of the puzzle,
        but can help visualize the land in between the lines of the full loop.</p>
        <center>
        Enter puzzle code (1-<span id='puzzlecount1'>0</span>) or descriptor
        (see "Puzzles" tab):<br/>
        <input type="text"                          id="userPuzzle"    size="40" />
        <input type="button" value="Display Puzzle" id="displayButton" class="button small" />
        </center>

      <div id="tab2" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        The full set of rules for Slitherlink can be found online. The simple description
        includes two basic rules. 1) You must connect adjacent dots with horizontal
        and vertical lines to make a complete loop that never crosses or touches
        itself. 2) A numbered cell indicates how many lines surround it; empty cells 
        may be surrounded by any number of lines. Numbers that have been violated
        with too many lines will be rendered in red. The whole puzzle's border will
        turn green upon successful completion. Intersections with more than two lines
        will turn red indicating illegal connections.

        This playground was written using javascript and is available open
        source. More later.
      </div>
      <div id="tab4" class="tab_content" style="display: none;">
        Puzzles can be invoked by either a numerical entry from
        1-<span id='puzzlecount2'>0</span>, or through a character
        description of the puzzle itself. The numbered puzzles are
        hand-crafted of varying difficulty, roughly easy to hard.
        To describe a puzzle, the character string must be of the
        form: "WxH:&lt;descriptor&gt;", where W is a number indicating
        the width of the grid, and H the height.  The descriptor is a
        definition of the grid contents from left to right, then top
        to bottom. A dash '-' can indicate an empty cell. For easier
        description of sparse puzzles, letter values from 'a' to 'z'
        can indicate 1 to 26 empty cells, respectively. A dot '.'
        can be used as a separator, for example between rows.
        An example descriptor is as follows: "7x7:1b2a13.0a2d.b3a30a.3b2b1.a31a2b.d2a3.02a3b3".
